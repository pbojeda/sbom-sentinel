## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- `sbom-sentinel scan` command: clones repositories, generates CycloneDX 1.6 SBOMs with cdxgen, scans with Trivy, and produces consolidated reports
- `sbom-sentinel init` command: generates a starter `sbom-sentinel.config.json`
- `sbom-sentinel check` command: verifies that `git`, `cdxgen` and `trivy` are installed
- `sbom-sentinel --dry-run` flag: shows what would be done without executing
- `sbom-sentinel --repo <name>` flag: scans a single repository by name
- Support for six ecosystems: `node`, `swift`, `gradle`, `python`, `go`, `rust`
- Two SBOM generation modes per repository:
  - `cdxgen` (default): runs cdxgen with the repository type
  - `command`: runs a custom script and copies its output
- Finding deduplication by `vulnerability_id + package + installed_version`
- Report generation in JSON, HTML (standalone, no external CSS) and plain text
- Slack notifications via webhook using native Node 20 `fetch`
- Email notifications via SMTP using optional `nodemailer` dependency
- Notifications triggered by: CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities (`onVulnerabilities`) and scan errors (`onErrors`)
- Token sanitization: git credentials are never written to logs or error messages
- Exit codes: `0` (ok), `1` (CRITICAL/HIGH found), `2` (scan errors)
- Configuration via `sbom-sentinel.config.json` and environment variables
- Environment variable priority over config file values
- Artifact naming convention: `{repo}__{branch}__{commitSha}__{timestamp}__{type}`
- Programmatic API: `scan()` and `loadConfig()` exported from the package root
- Full unit test suite with Vitest (121 tests, zero external tool calls in tests)
- Examples: Docker, Kubernetes CronJob, GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines
